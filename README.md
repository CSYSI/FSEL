## Prediction maps

We provide the prediction maps of our FSEL model in camouflaged object detection, salient object detection, and polyp segmentation tasks.

FSEL-camouflaged object detection (COD) (PVT/ResNet/Res2Net) [[baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ogYw7NNCJLahYzBurhvnKw),PIN:u5sb] 

FSEL-salient object detection (SOD) (PVT/ResNet) [[baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1oVgPSDeibQ2HN9LNnzzPbw),PIN:pelf] 

FSEL-polyp segmentation (PS) (PVT/ResNet) [[baidu](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1x-eeELRpKH1XZwvQGaPvAg),PIN:48bi] 


## Training weights

We give the training weights of our FSEL model in COD tasks.

Note that you should use the relevant network in the lib_initial file to test these .pth files
